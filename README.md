# Elm challenge Shore GmbH

This repository contains requirements definition of a project used for job applications to [Shore GmbH](https://shore.com)
for the position of a **frontend developer**

## Requirements
  - The challenge must be completed in the [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) language, v. 0.19
  - All naming including comments and additional documentation must be in English
  - The final result must be a full git repository with your challenge sollution


## Working on and Submitting of the Challenge
  - Fork this repository under your GitHub account.
  - Complete an implementation inside your fork.
  - When done, open a pull request against the original repository with your implementation.
  - Mark your pull request with the word *READY* when you're are done working, so that we know that we can start reviewing.

## Acceptance criteria
  - Store user's input into the model
  - Implement data validation (all fields are required, add any other validation you think is necessary)
  - Implement data submission
  - Only valid data should be submitted
  - Upon data submission, show the user input in a readable form (it's up to you to decide on the format)
  - Provide a way to the user to re-initialize the app (show the empty form again) after showing the input


## What We Would Consider a Plus
  - Going that extra mile on any aspect of the app


## Goal
The goal is to test candidate's ability to come up with a solution for a real world problem which could be a part of developers' day to day responsibilities.
Also we would like to evaluate the ability of a candidate to delve into a technology they are not familiar (or partially so) with.
